# Consumer integration

## Release checkout installation

Run installation from an inspectable checkout of the public release rather than
from a network downloader:

```powershell
git clone --branch v1.1.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/redducklabs/agent-handoff-toolkit.git agent-handoff-toolkit
Set-Location agent-handoff-toolkit
python distribution/runner.py install --target <consumer-repository> --release v1.1.0 --dry-run
python distribution/runner.py install --target <consumer-repository> --release v1.1.0 --apply
python distribution/runner.py sync --target <consumer-repository> --release v1.1.0 --check
python distribution/runner.py sync --target <consumer-repository> --release v1.1.0 --apply
```

Run install and sync only in an isolated, clean Git worktree. Confirm the
worktree is clean before planning, and prevent editors, hooks, or other processes
from writing target files until the command finishes.

Exit code `0` means a dry run is installable, an apply completed, or the sync
check is current. Exit code `1` means `sync --check` found safe pending
updates. Exit code `2` means invalid input, an unsafe path, source corruption,
an ownership conflict, an unusable `python` launcher, or a write failure.

## Runtime prerequisite

Before enabling either host's hooks, run `python --version` in the consumer repository. The `python` command must resolve to Python 3.11 or newer on every machine that uses the repository. `install` and `sync` refuse with a `launcher-unavailable` conflict when it does not resolve, cannot start, or is too old on the machine running them; a Windows Microsoft Store alias counts as unable to start. This requirement is machine-readable in the pinned release checkout's `distribution/manifest.json` and matches the launcher in every distributed hook fragment.

## Managed ownership and conflicts

Consumers pin a tagged toolkit release. The installer:

- provides `install --dry-run`, `install --apply`, `sync --check`, and `sync --apply`;
- copies the same canonical skill into `.agents/skills/agent-handoff/` and `.claude/skills/agent-handoff/` rather than use symlinks;
- merges managed instruction blocks into existing `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` without replacing project-specific content;
- merges Claude settings and installs Codex hooks without overwriting unrelated hooks;
- records the toolkit release, schema version, managed paths, and content hashes
  in `.agent-handoff-toolkit/install-state.json`;
- detects local edits, shows a patch, and refuses destructive replacement;
- keeps generated policy text derived from one canonical source.

The installer owns every copied file listed in the pinned release checkout's
`distribution/manifest.json`, the marked toolkit blocks in `AGENTS.md` and
`CLAUDE.md`, and the precise merged JSON entries in `.claude/settings.json` and
`.codex/hooks.json`. This includes the vendored runtime and license, contract,
consumer acceptance guide, both host skill copies, both record templates, and
both hook integrations. The installed
`.agent-handoff-toolkit/install-state.json` is the source of truth for the
pinned release, schema version, managed targets, modes, and installed hashes.
Existing project instructions and unrelated JSON settings remain
consumer-owned. The installer refuses locally modified, missing, or
identity-colliding owned content instead of overwriting it.

Every handoff record that existed before the current pinned release was adopted
in the consumer is a deprecated historical artifact by policy. Installation and
synchronization preserve those records as opaque files: do not open, read,
review, validate, migrate, summarize, reconcile, or rewrite them. No unresolved
question or content in those files gates adoption. The current policy applies
only to new or materially replaced records.

Each target is stale-checked immediately before its write and published with a
per-file atomic replacement. Multi-file atomicity is not provided. If a later
write fails, rollback is best effort and restores an earlier target only if its
current bytes still equal this run's output. Different current bytes are
preserved and reported. Inspect the worktree before retrying any failed apply.

## Post-install consumer acceptance

Run these checks on the installation branch before enabling routine use:

1. Run `sync --check` from the pinned release checkout. It must report `CURRENT`
   without changing the consumer worktree.
2. Compare `.agent-handoff-toolkit/install-state.json` with the pinned release
   checkout's `distribution/manifest.json`. Confirm every managed copy, managed
   block, and merge-owned JSON entry is represented. Hash-check the complete
   managed blocks, including their markers, and require the `AGENTS.md` and
   `CLAUDE.md` blocks to be byte-identical after LF normalization. Inspect the
   merged Claude and Codex hook JSON while leaving unrelated settings unchanged.
   For the acceptance test, pin the LF-normalized SHA-256 of the reviewed
   `install-state.json` as a test constant; never derive expected values from the
   state under test. The state is the installer's source of truth, not the
   acceptance test's oracle.
3. Verify that each host discovers the installed hook configuration and that its
   trust configuration permits command hooks. Confirm the host's stop-block cap
   is compatible with a synthetic bad-stop correction before enabling routine
   use. If real-host discovery and smoke are not observed, record the host as
   `unverified`; automatic Codex hook discovery is unverified until observed
   end-to-end in the consumer's actual Codex host. Direct runner execution is
   not host-discovery evidence.
4. From the consumer repository root, execute every installed Claude and Codex
   hook command directly with representative matching and non-matching input.
   Derive each command from the installed JSON rather than duplicating its
   argument list in the test. Assert that SessionStart emits the exact policy
   phrase `do not search or inspect deprecated legacy handoffs`; assert the
   phrase rather than a whole sentence, because the surrounding wording is the
   toolkit's to shorten. Then use a
   synthetic bad stop: require the exact lifecycle issue code, correct the stop,
   and confirm the corrected stop is accepted without retained prompt, reply, or
   transcript content. Do not infer runtime viability from valid JSON alone.
5. Create fresh disposable continuation and completion-audit records. Render and
   validate both record types. Assert the continuation's copy/paste tail and the
   completion audit's `Audit record (not a handoff)` link, including correct URL
   encoding, and assert that an audit emits no restart prompt. Include the highest
   authorized scope completion audit. Verification results and exact next actions
   must be derived from record metadata, not maintained as handwritten prose.
6. Reconcile project overlays at the policy level. Overlays may be stricter but
   cannot loosen or contradict the record-type decision, canonical derived
   sections, or final-tail requirements. This review never includes deprecated
   historical records.
7. Add consumer regression tests for the merged Claude and Codex hook JSON,
   install-state ownership and `CURRENT` status, schema-derived section parity,
   and continuation/completion record-decision semantics. Recursively assert
   every merge-owned JSON fragment, not only copied-file hashes. If this focused
   test runs in a container, mount every asserted managed artifact read-only.
   Missing, empty, wrong-type, or unmounted artifacts must fail, never skip.
8. Confirm a rendered continuation says the current session is stopped, directs
   the user to start a new session, and begins its fenced block for that new
   session with `Continue from handoff`. It must name the absolute record path and exact next
   action, include only essential blockers, decisions, and validation gates, and
   not reproduce record metadata or narrative sections.
9. Search active consumer-owned documentation and tests, excluding deprecated
   handoffs, for stale toolkit release tags, versions, commit pins, or
   assertions. Update every active reference to the exact installed release.

For a meta-only toolkit or handoff change, run only these focused local
acceptance checks; never launch the consumer's full local application, backend,
frontend, end-to-end, build, or dependency-audit suites. Let required
pull-request CI run normally. Run broader local suites only when product code
also changes.

Structural checks prove schema, ownership, merge, and runtime properties. They
do not prove that prose is semantically complete or truthful; that remains a
review responsibility for each new or materially replaced record.

## Opt-in host smoke command

After reviewing the installed hook configuration, run one host-specific smoke
check from the pinned release checkout with an empty disposable directory:

```powershell
python distribution/runner.py acceptance --platform claude --scratch <empty-scratch-directory> --release-source <pinned-release-checkout>
python distribution/runner.py acceptance --platform codex --scratch <empty-scratch-directory> --release-source <pinned-release-checkout>
```

The command initializes and installs into only the named scratch directory,
uses synthetic runtime-only scenario data, reduces captured host output in
memory, searches only that scratch/runtime path for the generated sentinel,
and removes the exact directory in `finally`. Its output contains only the
platform, pass/fail properties, and lifecycle issue codes; it never prints a
prompt, reply, transcript, record body, credential, or consumer content, and
retains none of them after the run. Do not run this command in ordinary public
CI.

The host is started with its configuration home redirected into the scratch
directory, so on a machine whose host credential lives in that home the host
would have no credential and could not start a session at all. That failure
reports as undiscovered hooks rather than as the missing prerequisite it is, so
the command copies the operator's existing host credential into the disposable
home for the duration of the run, creating the copy private to the operator, and
overwrites and removes it as soon as the host exits and before the retention
scan. The operator's own credential file is only ever read. No API key is
required, and none is accepted in its place.

`pass` requires observed trusted hook discovery, an initial blocked stop with
an issue code, a corrected stop, no retained synthetic content, and compatible
host block capacity. If a host executable is unavailable or trusted hook
discovery cannot be observed, its result is `unverified`, not `pass`.

Read the reported properties individually rather than only the overall status.
`discovered` is the property that answers whether the host finds, trusts, and
runs the installed hooks, and it is the one an installation most needs. The
`blocked`, `issue_received`, and `corrected` properties additionally require the
scenario to drive the host into a tracked session and back out of a blocked
stop, which depends on the host model's own behavior; a run may legitimately
report `discovered=pass` with those still failing. That combination is evidence
of hook discovery and not evidence of the block-and-correct cycle, which the
consumer's own focused tests should assert directly.
An installed runner requires the explicit, local pinned release checkout for
the disposable installation; an unavailable or unsafe release source exits
with a bounded prerequisite error rather than attempting an unverified run.

## Recovering a broken hook runtime

Every other lifecycle command needs a session key, challenge and expected
revision, and the hook flow is the only thing that issues them. When that flow
is what is failing, use the one command that needs none:

```bash
python .agent-handoff-toolkit/runner.py lifecycle doctor
python .agent-handoff-toolkit/runner.py lifecycle doctor --session-id <host session id>
```

It is read-only, changes nothing, requires no release checkout, and reports
where lifecycle state resolves, whether it opens, whether its lock is
reachable, which runner is installed and which one is running, and — with
`--session-id` — that session's enforcement mode. The derived session key and
the local HMAC secret never appear in its output.

A prompt is never blocked, whatever is wrong. `UserPromptSubmit` reports and
delivers the message, so a session can always be talked to, including when the
installed runtime cannot be imported at all. One exception remains and it is a
hang rather than a block: if another process holds `registry.lock` and never
releases it, a hook waits on it without a deadline. The lock is released when
its holder exits and every hold is a short read or write, so this needs a
wedged live process; if you see it, find that process rather than waiting.

Read the report against these rules:

- `lock` of `contended` means another session currently holds it, which is
  normal: every worktree of a repository shares one state root. The lock is
  probed rather than acquired for that line, so producing it does not wait on
  the holder. Opening state before the probe does take the lock, though, so a
  lock held and never released delays `doctor` itself; that is the same
  residual described above, and it is the one case where this command is not
  a reliable escape.
- `storage`, `state_root` or `lock` naming an exception class means state is
  unreachable. Sessions that declared no tracked work are unaffected: a fault
  there is reported as a notice and blocks nothing.
- `session.mode` of `open` or `one-off` means nothing is gated. A denial on
  such a session is a defect, not a policy decision; include the `failed=`
  detail from the message when reporting it.
- `installed_runner` and `running_from` differing means a hook resolved a
  different checkout's install than the one you are reading.

Explicit commands such as `validate`, `render-tail` and `doctor` name the
runner by a path relative to the current directory, so run them from the
repository root. The installed hook commands locate the runner by walking
upward and work from any subdirectory.

## Pilot migrations

Before bulk adoption, select one repository with mature handoffs and one with little or no handoff policy. In each pilot:

1. Inventory local instructions, hook and skill configuration, and tracker
   conventions. Count or locate historical handoff storage only if needed to
   protect it; do not open the records.
2. Run the v1.1.0 installer in dry-run mode from its release checkout.
3. Review the proposed instruction and hook merges.
4. Apply on a branch. Treat every record that predates this adoption as
   deprecated by policy without marking, reading, or rewriting individual files.
5. Exercise one continuation and one highest-scope completion audit in both Claude Code and Codex.
6. Record compatibility exceptions as project-local overlays, not forks of the core contract.

Broader rollout begins only after both pilots pass their repository checks and
agent workflows. The minimal-policy consumer verifies clean creation and runtime
operation. The mature-policy consumer resolves identity conflicts explicitly
and verifies that all project-owned instructions, settings, and overlays remain
unchanged. Consumer-specific implementation details stay in the consumer
repository.
